# Go CLI sandbox

What different techniques and approaches should I follow when creating a Go app? This project's evolution will try to answer that.

This app follows [Standard Go Project Layout
](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) and shamelessly borrows some of the practices laid out by [AAF Engineering](https://aaf.engineering/) in their series [Go Web Application Structure](https://aaf.engineering/go-web-application-structure-pt-1/), I will also probably explore using [Matt Ryer](https://twitter.com/matryer)'s presentation [How I write Go HTTP services after seven years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWBSMsLG8po&feature=emb_title) and [Go HTTP Server Best Practice](https://medium.com/@niondir/my-go-http-server-best-practice-a29773786e15).
